.SH NAME
mystrcat \- append one string to another
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B int mystrcat(char* dest, const char* src);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mystrcat()
function appends the string pointed to by \fIsrc\fR to the end of the string
pointed to by \fIdest\fR. The destination buffer must be large enough to hold
the combined string, including the terminating null character ('\0').
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the total length of the concatenated string (original length of \fIdest\fR plus length of \fIsrc\fR).
.SH ERRORS
If the destination buffer is too small, a buffer overflow may occur, as this function does not perform bounds checking.
