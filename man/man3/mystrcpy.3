.TH MYSTRCPY 3 "September 2025" "libmyutils" "Library Functions"
.SH NAME
mystrcpy \- copy a source string to a destination buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B int mystrcpy(char* dest, const char* src);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mystrcpy()
function copies the string pointed to by \fIsrc\fR, including the terminating null character ('\0'),
into the buffer pointed to by \fIdest\fR. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that
the destination buffer is large enough to hold the entire string safely.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the count of characters copied, excluding the terminating null character.
.SH ERRORS
If the \fIdest\fR buffer is too small, a buffer overflow may occur, as this function does not
perform any bounds checking.
