.SH NAME
mystrncpy \- copy up to n characters from one string to another
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B int mystrncpy(char* dest, const char* src, int n);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mystrncpy()
function copies up to \fIn\fR characters from the string pointed to by \fIsrc\fR
into the buffer pointed to by \fIdest\fR. If \fIsrc\fR is shorter than \fIn\fR characters,
the remaining space in \fIdest\fR is filled with null bytes to ensure proper termination.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the total number of characters written to \fIdest\fR.
.SH ERRORS
If the \fIdest\fR buffer is smaller than \fIn\fR, a buffer overflow may occur since
this function does not perform bounds checking.
